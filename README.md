# challenge-3
## main changes
- In this challenge I added java script in order to make the password generator usable.
- First I added a few variables at the top to target for the characters for the password.
- Then I added a function to generate the password.
- After that I added a few more variables to create the prompt.
- Then I added if statements so that if user didn't select any characters to restart prompt.
-after that I created a few more variables to target different confirms on the prompt.
- I added another if stating that the length can't be over a certain number or below another.
-added another if statement with an alert stating you need to select at least one of the characters listed in the confirm statements.
- I also added a for loop at the end of the function to generate the actual random password using variables I already created and put a return under so that the generated password would display at the very end.
- Lastly I added one more if and else statement making sure that undefined wouldn't come back if you failed to select another character during the prompt.
